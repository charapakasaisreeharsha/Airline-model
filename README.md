# Airline_model
**Problem-statement**
 Train a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this task, you should use an algorithm that easily allows you to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power.

**Outcome**
I trained ML-model using RandomFOrest Algorithm where i derived and found the customers booking intresets and what kind of variables(sitting,services,boarding etc..) factors effects the purchasing power. Which variable has more importance were company should take care to attract more customers.
